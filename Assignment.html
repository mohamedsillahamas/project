<h1>THIS IS OUR FIRST PARAGRAPHS</h1>
<p align ="left">
    I believe it important that we are always a perfect match even if it mean we do not fit in with other people, because when we are not truly ourselves it is impossible for us to be happy. 
    It is important for us to be fulfilled. So, when you are not hanging with people that you relly do not fit with, and you get that felling deep down that your inner self is telling you are no conformable.
    Which mean that you are   not happy. So, it is super important that we are always, always full yourself, be true to you. 

<p align ="right">
    So, no one can tell you what a successful life is, no one can tell you what a great life is and no one can tell you how to be happy or what you should or should not be doing with your life only God so live the path of his words. 
    No one can, because you are unique. What success is for another, might not be success for you. What a great life is for another, may not be great for you. What light up another which are not of God, may dim your light. The only way you can be happy in this life,
    the only way you can be successful is if you be you. Now listen GRACE the only way to get the most out of this life is to follow your own positive path. To follow your intuition, to listen to your own heart that is where the answers are. 
    The answer to every question you needs the answer for. 


<p align ="justify">
So many people are un happy in this world because they are living lives, they do not want to live so they can fit in or may be some one completely different from them gave them advise on how they should be living. 
You are unique so you must fellow your unique path, Be yourself. Now this doesn’t mean there is not useful information out there so many great teachers of God words to learn from, it simply means you only take resonates with you. 
What you know will work for you, get out of your head and get in to your heart. Do things that make you light up. And more things that will make you smile like a little kid. Be brave to do the things of God you only set one shot of your life, 
one opportunity to live fully, one opportunity to create some magic of being different with other. 

<P align ="center">
    It ok to say no sometimes, to say no with passion. With authentic certainty because you know what is best for you. Every body will get it and it that ok, 
    the right people will work the path with you and most won’t even be able to resist it because some one who is Genuinely and who is authentically loving life doing exactly what they want to do that person is infectious. 
    Real passion is infectious, weak up with passion every day. Weak up every single day and be no one but fully 100% you.
